# Cip.w
An app for encoding your password and fun ways to remember!

When I was small, I love to do secret passwords and such. So during this second semester break, I figured I should give this a go.    
Started 18/1/19       
- worked on some cipher I wanted.   
- Can only do encoding

Ultimate Goal by end of Jan
- [ ] A better UI/UX for encoding and decrypt   
- [ ] Maybe some animation to show the process      

What cipher I want to top up         
- [x] more COMBINATION CIPHER eg custom made on your own(figuring out)        
- [ ] MOON RUNES(I like Hobbit)              

I'm welcome to any ideas on how to improve this app. Even better if you got some idea on interesting encoding and want me to include.
