# Cip.w
An app for encoding your password and fun ways to remember!

When I was small, I love to do secret passwords and such. So during this second semester break, I figured I should give this a go.    
Started 18/1/19       
+worked on some cipher I wanted.   
+Can only do encoding

Ultimate Goal by end of Jan
+A better UI/UX for encoding and decrypt   
+Maybe some animation to show the process    
+A pdf?(thought it'll be cool but have no ideas on this part yet)    

What cipher I want to top up         
+ more COMBINATION CIPHER eg custom made on your own(figuring out)        
+ MOON RUNES(I like Hobbit)              

I'm welcome to any ideas on how to improve this app. Even better if you got some idea on interesting encoding and want me to include.
